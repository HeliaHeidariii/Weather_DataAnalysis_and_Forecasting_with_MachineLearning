# Weather_DataAnalysis_and_Forecasting_with_MachineLearning
 This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze weather data and provide predictions for future weather conditions. It includes models for temperature, humidity, and other atmospheric variables, and evaluates performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and F1 score.


## Features

- **Weather Data Processing**: Cleans and preprocesses weather datasets, preparing them for analysis.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to predict weather conditions.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualization**: Displays trends and predictions using graphs to better understand weather patterns.

## Technologies Used

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
- **matplotlib**: For visualizing the weather trends and predictions.
- **numpy**: For handling numerical operations.

## How to Use

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   First, install the required libraries by running:

   ```bash
   pip install scikit-learn pandas matplotlib numpy
   ```

2. **Prepare the Dataset**  
   Ensure that your weather dataset is in CSV format and contains features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc. Modify the script as needed to load the data from the correct path.

3. **Run the Notebook**  
   Open and execute the provided Jupyter notebook to run the data analysis and prediction models.

4. **Visualize Results**  
   The notebook will produce visualizations that show trends and prediction outputs for different weather conditions.

## Example Output

After training the models, the notebook will output predictions and their corresponding evaluation metrics, including:

- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the predictions.
- **Precision**: Evaluates the number of true positive results against all positive results.
- **Recall**: Measures the ability to detect all relevant cases.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
